# RNAS-sgRNA
RNAS-sgRNA is a deep learning framework for analyzing and predicting sgRNA activity
# # 1. Neural Architecture Search (NAS) on Benchmark Dataset
File: pretrained_model (2).py

- AutoKeras to perform NAS on a benchmark sgRNA dataset.

- The dataset is preprocessed (e.g., sequences are one-hot encoded).

- The model is trained and saved as best_autokeras_model.h5.
